Small package to help building ESM NPM packages.

https://sw.cowtech.it/esm-package-utils

## Usage

After your files have been compiled, let's say in `dist/mjs` folder, you can run the following (or include in `package.json` scripts):

```sh
renamer --find js --replace mjs dist/mjs/* && esm-pkg-add-imports-extensions -e mjs dist/mjs/**
```

This command will rename any file toÂ `.mjs` extension and will make sure that any local `import ... from` or `export ... from` has `.mjs` or `index.mjs` at the end of the path.
